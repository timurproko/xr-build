# @xr-build/ui-kit

Basic hand-operated controls for three.js apps on 3D displays: button (pill and
round), switch, segmented control, slider and stepped slider, dial, trackball and text label.
Every control is a `THREE.Group` with a title and a status line, sized in metres (one scene unit =
one metre with the UI Kit's world mapping; any other mapping works, the SDK core converts).

```ts
import { createXrb } from '@xr-build/sdk';
import { Button, Slider } from '@xr-build/ui-kit';

const xrb = createXrb(renderer, { mapping: { mode: 'world', center: new THREE.Vector3(), scale: 1 }, pointer: false });
const button = new Button({ title: 'Button', shape: 'pill', text: 'Press' });
const slider = new Slider({ title: 'Slider', value: 0.5, length: 0.13 });
scene.add(button, slider);
for (const c of [button, slider]) c.attach(xrb.interaction);   // hands through the SDK's interaction core
xrb.bindMouse();                                               // the same controls with the mouse
scene.add(xrb.cursorObject);                                   // where the mouse points, visible on a 3D display

button.on('click', (e) => console.log(e.source));   // 'hand' | 'mouse'
slider.on('change', (e) => console.log(e.value));

function animate(now) {
  for (const c of controls) c.update(dt);
  xrb.render(scene, camera);
}
```

## Controls and events

| control | hands | events (`detail`) |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` | poke (fingertip pushes the cap, click at 60 % of the travel, release below 30 %); round buttons take a Lucide icon (`icon: ArrowRight` from `lucide`, `iconStroke` for weight) | `click` `{ source }`, `release` `{ source }` |
| `Switch` | poke anywhere on it | `change` `{ on, source }` |
| `Segmented` | poke a segment | `change` `{ index, value, source }` |
| `Slider` | touch-drag the handle, pinch near it, or poke the track to jump | `grab` `{ mode: 'touch' \| 'pinch' \| 'mouse' }`, `change` `{ value, step, source }`, `release` `{ mode }` |
| `Dial` | pinch at the knob and circle | `grab` `{ mode }`, `change` `{ value, source }`, `release` |
| `Trackball` | reach into the sphere and move; mouse arcball | `grab` / `release` `{ mode: 'hand' }`, `rotate` `{ axis, total }` |
| `Dialog` | frosted-glass sheet lifted toward the viewer (`lift`, default 7 cm) with a heading, text and a Close button; `open()` / `close()` | `open` / `close` `{ source }` |
| `Label` | - | - |

`control.setEnabled(false)` greys it out (colours toward a grey, nothing turns see-through), drops any press or grab in progress (the core releases its
targets) and ignores input until enabled again. `control.mouseOver` tells whether the mouse points at it.

## How input works

A control owns interaction targets of the SDK core (`PokeTarget`, `PinchTarget`, `VolumeTarget`) in
its own frame and reads `target.state` each frame for hover, depth and held; it has no hand code.
The core gives each hand one target (the nearest that qualifies), keeps a press or grab through
sideways drift, tracking noise and short dropouts, and releases only on a deliberate retract, pinch
end or when the hand is gone past the grace period. The mouse goes through the same targets.

## Tuning

All thresholds come from the SDK's `DEFAULT_TUNING` (hover distance 5 cm, poke margin 1 cm, pinch
radius 5 cm, ...): override for the app with `createXrb(renderer, { interaction: { tuning: { ... } } })`.
Reachable sizes with the defaults: every poke area is at least 3 cm across (outline + 1 cm margin
each side), pinch handles engage within 5 cm. `TUNING.ease` in `theme.ts` is animation only.

## Tests

`node --test "test/**/*.test.ts"` drives the controls through the core with synthetic scene hands
and mouse rays (a small DOM shim stands in for canvas and audio).
